This repo is for the reporting of issues found within and when using BMP Database Online Statistical Tool (BDOST).

### Labels
This is the best way to interact directly with the BDOST team.
We will be monitoring and responding to issues as our schedules and work loads allow.
Please attempt to avoid filing duplicates of open or closed items when possible.
In the spirit of openness we will be tagging issues with the following:

- **bug** – We consider this issue to be a bug internally.
  This tag is generally for bugs in implemented features, or something we consider to be a "bug level" change.

- **enhancement** – Denotes something that is not yet implemented, but we hope to have in the future.

- **discussion** – Denotes a discussion on the board that does not relate to a specific feature.

- **bydesign** – Denotes that an issue is raised that we consider is working as intended.
  We will give some reasoning why this is by design.
  After one week we will either close the issue or mark as Discussion depending on what comes up.

### Closing issues
Issues may be closed by the original poster at any time.
We will close issues if:

- After the issue has been fixed
- An issue is clearly a dup of another. 
  The duplicate will be linked
- Any discussion that has clearly run its course
